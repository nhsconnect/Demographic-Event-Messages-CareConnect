summary: "The FHIR profiles used for the PDS Death Notification event message bundle"
---

PDS Death Notification event messages are generated by the Spine and published to the NEMS when a patient's death notification status is changed within PDS. The death notification status of the patient is carried within the event message as specified in the guidance on this page.

## FHIR Profiles ##

The following FHIR profiles are used to form the PDS Death Notification Event Message Bundle:

- [Bundle](http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/StructureDefinition/Bundle)
- [Event-MessageHeader-1](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/Event-MessageHeader-1) - where the coding and display elements for the 'event' type are fixed to 'pds-death-notification-1 \| PDS Death Notification'
- [CareConnect-Communication-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Communication-1)
- [CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1)
- [CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1)
- [CareConnect-HealthcareService-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-HealthcareService-1)

## Bundle Structure

Specifies referencing within the Event Message Bundle.

</div>

The `extension(deathNotificationStatus)` and `deceasedDateTime` elements within the patient resource are the main indicators of the patient's death status.


## PDS Death Notification Event Message Types ##

The PDS Death Notification event message will be sent by the NEMS, following an update to the patient death information on PDS. This information includes the death notification status which may be updated should the patient’s death notification status change. The event message behaviour following each update to the patient’s death notification status is demonstrated in the table below:

If a subscriber receives multiple `PDS Death Notification` event messages for the same patient, the latest event message as indicated by the `meta.lastUpdated` element within the MessageHeader resource should be considered the source of truth for the deathNotificationStatus element. This is the specific dateTime on which the deathNotificationStatus element was updated on PDS.

The below table is included to highlight the different types of Death Notification event message you may receive and the key elements within resource which help identify the type of Death Notification event message you have received. Additional guidance around the content of the FHIR resources is outlined in the `Resource population requirements and guidance` section below.

|  | PDS Death Notification (Informal) | PDS Death Notification (Formal) | PDS Death Notification (Death Notification Status removed) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Death notice received via an update from a local NHS Organisation such as GP or Trust | Death notice received from Registrar of Deaths | A revoke of a patient death event, as the death was entered in error, i.e. the patient is _not dead_. |
| **Event-MessageHeader-1 Resource** |
| `extension(messageEventType)` | Fixed value: `new` | Fixed value: `new` | Fixed value: `new` |
| `event` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` | Fixed value: `pds-death-notification-1` |
| **CareConnect-Communication-1 Resource** |
| `status` | Fixed value: `completed` | Fixed value: `completed` | Fixed value: `completed` |
| **CareConnect-Patient-1 Resource** |
| `extension(deathNotificationStatus)` | Fixed value: 1 (Informal) | Fixed value: 2 (Formal) | Fixed value: U (Removed) |
| `deceasedDateTime` | element populated with dateTime of death | element populated with dateTime of death | **element not included in resource** |


## Onward Delivery ##

The delivery of the PDS Death Notification event messages to subscribers via MESH will use the following `WorkflowID` within the MESH control file. This `WorkflowID` will need to be added to the receiving MESH mailbox configuration before event messages can be received.

| MESH WorkflowID | `CHILDHEALTH_DEATHNOTIFICATION_UPDATE` |
